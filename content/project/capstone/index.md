This project employs a predictive correlational design to determine how accurately one can predict a song's popularity on Spotify and its chances of becoming a number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 charts using SAS Enterprise Miner and the song's tempo, energy, key, loudness, mode, etc. Also, the project compares various statistical models, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), linear and logistic regression, decision trees (DTs), ensembles, etc. Finally, the project combines information from multiple heterogeneous data sources.
