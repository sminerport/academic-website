This project implements predictive analytics and the cross-industry process for data mining (CRISP-DM) to predict how much medicine a hospital needs to keep on hand each year to treat all patients and reduce overstock costs. The project uses SAS to compare various statistical models, including decisiton trees (DTs), linear and logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machines (SVMs).
